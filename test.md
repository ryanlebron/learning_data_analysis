1. MHD Equations
  - Mass Conservation
    - $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \tau} + \nabla \cdot (\rho u) = 0$
    - $\rho$ is
  - Momentum Conservation
    - $\rho(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla u) = -\nabla P + \overrightarrow{j} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
      - $\overrightarrow{j}$ is current density, $\overrightarrow{B}$ is magnetic field, and their cross product is the Lorentz force
  - Ohm's Law
    - $j = \sigma E'_{r}$
      - $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the medium, and $E'_{r}$ is the displacement field
      - The displacement field is the electric field in the frame of the fluid.
        - To change the frame of reference, use a Lorentzian transform, so $E' = \overrightarrow{E} + \overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
