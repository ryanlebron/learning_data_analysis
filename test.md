1. MHD Equations
  - Mass Conservation
    - $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \tau} + \nabla \cdot (\rho u) = 0$
    - $\rho$ is
  - Momentum Conservation
    - $\rho(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla u) = -\nabla P + \overrightarrow{j} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
      - $\overrightarrow{j}$ is current density, $\overrightarrow{B}$ is magnetic field, and their cross product is the Lorentz force
  - Ohm's Law
    - $j = \sigma E'_{r}$
      - $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the medium, and $E'_{r}$ is the displacement field
      - The displacement field is the electric field in the frame of the fluid.
        - To change the frame of reference, use a Lorentzian transform, so $E' = \overrightarrow{E} + \overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{B}$

Instructions:
Make a copy of this file in the directory for its corresponding week,replacing the [TEMPLATE]
in the title with the date in Mon.-Day format (ex: Jan-29-recap.md).
(You can also just go into Edit mode, copy the contents and paste them into a new markdown file
you make in the corresponding directory).
Remove all the template text (anything between ``` ```) and fill in with your recap.
When you're ready, submit with the commmit title:

### Outline 

1. MHD Equations
  - Mass Conservation
    - $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \tau} + \nabla \cdot (\rho u) = 0$
    - $\rho$ is
  - Momentum Conservation
    - $\rho(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla u) = -\nabla P + \overrightarrow{j} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
      - $\overrightarrow{j}$ is current density, $\overrightarrow{B}$ is magnetic field, and their cross product is the Lorentz force
  - Ohm's Law
    - $j = \sigma E'_{r}$
      - $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the medium, and $E'_{r}$ is the displacement field
      - The displacement field is the electric field in the frame of the fluid.
        - To change the frame of reference, use a Lorentzian transform, so $E' = \overrightarrow{E} + \overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
  - Maxwell's Equations
    - $\overrightarrow{\nabla} \times \overrightarrow{E} = -\frac{\partial \overrightarrow{B}}{\partial t}$
      - $-\frac{\partial \overrightarrow{B}}{\partial t} = \overrightarrow{\nabla} \times (\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
    - $\overrightarrow{\nabla} \times \overrightarrow{B} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \overrightarrow{\E}}{\partial t} = \mu_0 \overrightarrow{j}$
      - $\overrightarrow{j} = -\rho e (\overrightarrow{u}_{e} - \overrightarrow{u}_{i}$

### Questions 
```
- A question came up about the form of Ohm's law being used, with the one used in class being the original statment, vs. what is taught for circuitry.
